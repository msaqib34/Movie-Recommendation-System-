### Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using a dataset of 40,000 movies. The system merges multiple files, cleans the data, extracts necessary information, and employs various techniques to recommend movies based on their similarity.

#### Data Preparation:

1. **Data Merging**: The system merges multiple files containing movie data to create a comprehensive dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant data such as movie titles, genres, and other attributes are extracted from the dataset.

#### Tag Generation:

1. **Tag Creation**: A new column of tags is generated based on the extracted movie attributes. These tags help in representing the essence of each movie.

2. **Count Vectorization**: Count vectorization is applied to the tags column to convert the textual data into numerical format, which can be used for similarity computation.

#### Recommendation Process:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Cosine similarity is utilized to measure the similarity between movies based on their tag vectors.

2. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the computed similarity scores, the system recommends movies similar to the ones provided by the user.

#### How to Use:

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc. 

2. **Dataset**: Download the dataset containing movie information and place it in the designated directory.

3. **Run the Code**: Execute the main script `recommendation function` to initiate the recommendation process.

4. **Input**: Provide the name of a movie for which you want recommendations.

5. **Output**: Receive a list of recommended movies based on their similarity to the input movie.

#### Additional Notes:

- This system can be further optimized and customized by experimenting with different algorithms and parameters.
- The accuracy of recommendations can be enhanced by incorporating user preferences and feedback into the recommendation process.
- Visualization tools can be integrated to provide users with a more interactive experience.

#### Contribution:

Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit bug fixes, enhancements, or new features via pull requests.
